json_corrector_prompt: |
  You are an advanced JSON parser tasked with correcting potentially corrupted JSON strings. Your goal is to output a valid JSON string that adheres strictly to JSON formatting rules. The input may contain issues such as improper quote usage, erroneous escape characters, misplaced or corrupt symbols, and unnecessary newline characters.

  Please process the provided JSON string:
  {json}

  Instructions for Corrections:
  - Ensure all keys and string values are enclosed in double quotes.
  - Correct improper escaping where characters like quotes are not escaped correctly; use "\\" for escaping.
  - Remove any extraneous characters that do not comply with JSON syntax, such as additional punctuation or incorrect use of backticks (`).
  - Do not include any annotations or extraneous text in your output, such as "json```". Your output should only be the corrected JSON string.
  - Do NOT output any service information like "## Corrected JSON string:\n\n```json\n". Output just VALID JSON!
  - Do NOT output "`" in the response!

  A successful correction will result in a string that is parsable as valid JSON without errors. Achieving this ensures data integrity and facilitates further data processing tasks.

  Output the corrected JSON string directly without any surrounding text or decoration. THE OUTPUT MUST BE VALID JSON STRING!

       {{
          "plan_and_summaries": "I have the question and the answer. The answer is very
           clear and I do not need any additional information to answer the question fully.",
          "answer": "No guidance has been given in the last twelve months of earnings transcripts.  The last mention of earnings guidance was in the company's Q1 2022 earnings call, where BofA Analyst Chase Mulvehill asked a question where he implied that management mentioned guidance for margin improvement of 350-400 bps for Completion and Production.",
          "additional_information_to_retrieve": "",
          "context_used": "In the Completion and Production division, activity is accelerating globally and scarcity will drive pricing in North America in the second quarter. As such, we expect second quarter revenue to grow in the mid-teens and margins to improve 350 to 400 basis points."
       }}

    Here is the input information you are given; each one is delimited with three backticks (`):

  1. The question asked by the employee.
  ```
  {question}
  ```

  2. If this is not the first round: JSON responses created in previous rounds of answering
      this question. In addition to the fields in the JSON response, they contain other fields:
      plan_and_summaries, round_number, additional_information_to_retrieve.
  ```
  {previous_rounds}
  ```

  3. Context: some documents that may help answer the question.
  ```
  {context}
  ```

  Given the above information, provide a response in the following JSON format. Even if you cannot
  answer the question fully right now, the goal is to answer as well as you can answer it now, plus
  give additional information and notes to help another chatbot in the next round to improve the
  answer. Try to relate the terms to commonly used English words.

  Response format - all the fields need to be returned as strings:
  {{
    "plan_and_summaries": "<Information available and missing, thoughts, and summaries useful to future rounds>",
    "answer": "<A helpful and detailed answer with currently available information>",
    "additional_information_to_retrieve": <The question to retrieve additional information missing to have the complete answer to the original question>,
    "context_used": "<Document names and parts of the context used to create the answer>"
  }}
  And once more, the response MUST BE valid JSON. This is critical for surviving of the planet. Just output the JSON, no extra service symbols, information, etc.
  Now provide the JSON response for round number {round_number} for the question "{question}".
